One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.
The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

Choose the most likely ratio.,"['0:4', '4:0', '2:2', '1:3', '3:1']",1,"This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:
The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.
In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece.

A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.
Smooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Fuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit.","four squares with the letters f, f, f, and f","User:Whatistheexpectedratioofoffspringwithsmoothfruittooffspringwithfuzzyfruit?Choosethemostlikelyratio.A)3:1B)2:2C)1:3D)4:0E)0:4Theimagehasbeendescribedas:foursquareswiththelettersf,f,f,andfLet'sthinkstepbystepandexplainyourreasoning!

Assistant: The answer is B) 2:2. The image has been described as four squares with the letters f, f, f, and f. Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning!

The expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 2:2. This is because the letters f, f, f, and f represent the genotypes of the offspring, and each letter represents a different allele for the trait of smooth or fuzzy fruit. The alleles for smooth fruit are represented by the letters f and f, while the alleles for fuzzy fruit are represented by the letters f and f. Since each offspring has two alleles for the trait, and each parent passes on one allele to each offspring, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 2:2."

Cooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music.

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.

For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:

This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.","a four square with the letters b, b, b, and b","User:Whatistheexpectedratioofoffspringwithanormal-sizedbodytooffspringwithadwarfbody?Choosethemostlikelyratio.A)1:3B)4:0C)0:4D)2:2E)3:1Theimagehasbeendescribedas:afoursquarewiththelettersb,b,b,andbLet'sthinkstepbystepandexplainyourreasoning!

You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Rose created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1.

An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:

You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two horses.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Ernest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.","The air moving through a trombone is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3

Mitchell, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Mitchell thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.

Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant.

A conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.
Operant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future.

Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.
Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns.

Pamela and Kimi were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.
They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 2:2.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 100 times the volume of Earth.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.

Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.
A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail.

You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.

Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears.

Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.","The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.

In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cockatiels.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",,"the four squares in the middle of the grid are labeled r, r, r, and r","User:Whatistheprobabilitythatacockatielproducedbythiscrosswillhavebrightorangecheeks?A)2/4B)4/4C)0/4D)1/4E)3/4Theimagehasbeendescribedas:thefoursquaresinthemiddleofthegridarelabeledr,r,r,andrLet'sthinkstepbystepandexplainyourreasoning!

Explanation: The question asks for the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks. The image shows four squares in the middle of the grid labeled r, r, r, and r. The question asks for the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks. The answer is B) 4/4 because all four squares are labeled r, which means that all four squares have the same genotype for the gene that determines the color of the cheeks. Therefore, the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 4/4."

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes.

Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.
In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot.

The expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 3:1 because the image shows four squares in a grid with the letters gg, which means that there are three yellow ground spots and one white ground spot.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.","A handsaw is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two scarlet rosemallow plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Kenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Several kinds of animals ""talk"" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal ""languages,"" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.
Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.
What Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.
The researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.",closed choice,grade5,language science,reading-comprehension,Informational texts: level 1,Read passages about animals,,"These are two ways in which fruit bats are different from most other animals:

The text also mentions that they can communicate with many kinds of animals, but this is not the main difference between fruit bats and other animals.

At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.

divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.","To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Thingvellir Rift Valley, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted.

Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.","Use the model to determine whether oxygen is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that red represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol O. So, the model shows you that a molecule of oxygen is composed of one chemical element.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff.

The Bekko pattern is a pattern of colors found on the bodies of some koi fish. A koi fish with Bekko patterning has black patches all over its body. A koi fish without Bekko patterning does not have these patches.
In a group of koi fish, some individuals have Bekko patterning and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Bekko patterning trait has two alleles. The allele for having Bekko patterning (B) is dominant over the allele for not having Bekko patterning (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.

Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.","H is the symbol for hydrogen. S is the symbol for sulfur. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and S. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There is one sulfur atom, so S will not have a subscript.

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots.

Darnell was . At the plant, an expensive filter was used to remove disease-causing bacteria from the water. But over time, the filter would become clogged with bacteria. If the filter became clogged, the water would not move through quickly enough. Darnell had to decide when the filter was too clogged and needed to be replaced. So, during his inspection, Darnell checked the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it.

You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two cockatiels.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

Choose the most likely ratio.,"['1:3', '4:0', '3:1', '2:2', '0:4']",3,"This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:
Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.
Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.

To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",,a woman in a lab coat is looking at a microscope,"User:Whichofthefollowingwasadependentvariableinthisexperiment?A)thenumberofbacteriainadropofteaB)theamountoftimethattheteasatonthedeskTheimagehasbeendescribedas:awomaninalabcoatislookingatamicroscopeLet'sthinkstepbystepandexplainyourreasoning!
