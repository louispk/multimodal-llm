An apostrophe is a figure of speech in which a speaker addresses a person or thing that is not present. In the given text, the speaker is addressing the goddess and asking her to sing about the anger of Achilles. This is an example of apostrophe because the goddess is not present in the scene, but the speaker is addressing her directly.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.
The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.",The four possible combinations of two dice,four squares with the letters f and f,"The image shows a square grid with four quadrants.

The top one is the correct way.
 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is A) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. BECAUSE: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
The strength of a magnetic force is affected by the distance between magnets. The magnetic force is greater when the magnets are closer together.
So, Pair 2 has a greater distance between the magnets, which means the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.","User: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair.

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is A) It has year-round rain. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients. BECAUSE: A rainforest is a type of wet, or rain, forest. The amount of rain that a rainforest gets each year is much greater than other types of forests. Rainforests get an average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain each year. That is more than 4 feet (130 cm.) of rain each year!
Rainforests are found in three main areas around the world: the Amazon Basin in South America, the Congo Basin in Africa, and Southeast Asia.
Rainforests have a very hot and wet climate. The temperature rarely gets higher than 93°F (34°C) or lower than 68°F (20°C).
Rainforests have two main layers of trees. The emergent layer contains a few very tall trees. The canopy layer contains the tops of most of the trees. The canopy shades the layers of plants below it.
The soil in a rainforest is often very thin. This is because the heavy rainfall in a rainforest washes away the nutrients in the soil.
The plants in a rainforest have adapted to the heavy rainfall and poor soil. Many plants have large leaves that help them collect rainwater. Some plants have roots that help them collect water and nutrients.
The animals in a rainforest have adapted to the heavy rainfall and the two main layers of trees. Many animals spend their lives in the trees. Some animals have adapted to the hot and wet climate by not needing to drink water. They get the water they need from the food they eat."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.

A physical change is a change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition. In both cases, the substances are changing their form or appearance, but not their chemical composition.

In the first case, the butter is melting due to the heat of the day, which is causing it to change from a solid to a liquid. This is a physical change because the butter is still made up of the same molecules, but they are just arranged differently.

In the second case, the sand and water are mixing to form a new substance called wet sand. This is also a physical change because the sand and water are still made up of the same molecules, but they are just arranged differently.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.

Kenneth wanted to grow cucumbers from seeds. He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Kenneth wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated.
Kenneth prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75°F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85°F and placed it under the other potting tray. Kenneth observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.

Assistant: The answer is Jackson. BECAUSE: The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the United States House of Representatives—the lower chamber—comprises the legislature of the United States. The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol, in Washington, D.C. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety, with each state being equally represented by two senators, regardless of its population, serving staggered terms of six years; with 50 states currently being represented, there are 100 senators from a total of 50 constituent states. The Senate can initiate all bills for raising revenue, as well as legislation to amend the United States Constitution. The Senate confirms executive and judicial nominations and ratifies treaties. It has the power to try impeachment cases, and it elects the vice president as the president of the Senate. The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives, due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere. The Senate is sometimes called the ""world's greatest deliberative body"". The Constitution stipulates that no constitutional amendment may be created to deprive a state of its equal suffrage in the Senate without that state's consent. The District of Columbia and all other territories of the United States are not entitled to representation in either house of the Congress. The District of Columbia elects two ""shadow U.S. Senators"", but they are officials of the D.C. City Government and not members of the U.S. Senate.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.
Smooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Fuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit.

The expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 3:1. This is because the dominant allele (F) is responsible for smooth fruit, while the recessive allele (f) is responsible for fuzzy fruit.
When two heterozygous individuals (FF) mate, the possible combinations of alleles in their offspring are FF, Ff, fF, and ff.

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is C) Both are caused by heating.

Explanation:

When dry ice sublimates, it goes directly from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid. This is a physical change because the chemical composition of the substance does not change. The heat from the campfire causes the marshmallow to melt and turn brown, which is also a physical change. Therefore, both changes are caused by heating.","User: What do these two changes have in common?

Cooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Jeremiah set up five pairs of platform bird feeders around his yard. He filled one feeder in each pair with sunflower seeds and the other feeder with flax seeds. For one week, Jeremiah watched cardinals visiting the feeders during the same hour each morning. During his observations, Jeremiah counted the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with sunflower seeds and the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with flax seeds.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",,In this image I can see a bird which is in red and black color and the bird is on the chain which is in black color.,a red bird is perched on a bird feeder,"The image features a vibrant red cardinal perched on a bird feeder filled with sunflower seeds.

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is A) Vanuatu. BECAUSE: A map is a visual representation of an area—real or imagined. The earliest maps known in the world are of the heavens, dating to the Divine Plan of the ancient Babylonians. The word “map” comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, “map” became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.
Maps are created by cartographers. Cartography pertains to the practice and study of map-making. It has been an essential technique for humans to navigate the world for thousands of years. It is also a useful tool in the fields of geography, exploration, and navigation.
There are two primary types of maps:
1. Physical maps - These show the natural features of a place, like mountains, landforms, and natural resources.
2. Political maps - These show the human-made boundaries and names of places, like countries, states, and cities.
There are also numerous other types of maps, including climatic maps, topographic maps, and star charts.
Maps are typically made using a map projection. A map projection is a way of transferring the three-dimensional surface of the Earth onto a two-dimensional plane. Because the Earth is a sphere, it is impossible to create an accurate two-dimensional map of the entire world. As a result, cartographers have to choose which parts of the Earth to exaggerate and which parts to compress.
There are four primary types of map projections:
1. Conformal - These projections maintain the shapes of the features they represent.
2. Equal-area - These projections maintain the size of the features they represent.
3. Equidistant - These projections maintain the distance between the features they represent.
4. Compromise - These projections are a mix of the other three types.
The most famous map projections are the Mer","User: Which country is highlighted? A) Vanuatu B) Tonga C) the Marshall Islands D) NauruThe image has been described as: a map of australia with a green square in the middle

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.

A) Solution B B) neither; their concentrations are the same C) Solution AThe image has been described as: two different types of solution in a flask
 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is A. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute per unit volume of solvent. In this case, the solute is the green particles and the solvent is the liquid. The concentration of a solution can be measured in different units, such as molarity (M), which is the number of moles of solute per liter of solvent.

In the image, we have two solutions in a flask. Solution A has a volume of 40 mL and contains 40 green particles. Solution B has a volume of 50 mL and contains 50 green particles. To determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, we need to calculate the number of moles of solute in each solution and divide it by the volume of the solution.

The number of moles of solute in a solution can be calculated using the formula:

Moles of solute = (Number of particles) x (Molar mass of solute) / (Avogadro's number)

In this case, we don't know the molar mass of the green particles, so we can't calculate the number of moles of solute directly. However, we can compare the concentrations of the two solutions by calculating the ratio of the number of moles of solute in each solution to the volume of the solution.

The ratio of the number of moles of solute to the volume of the solution is called the molarity (M) of the solution. The formula for molarity is:

Molarity (M) = (Number of moles of solute) / (Volume of solution)

For Solution A, the molarity is:

Molarity (M) = (Number of moles of solute) / (Volume of solution)

= (40 x Molar mass of solute) / (40 x Avogadro's number) / (40 mL)

= (40 x M"

Sand and mud are examples of sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor.
Over time, sediment can be pressed together to form sedimentary rock. You can observe a sedimentary rock to learn about the environment in which the sediment was deposited.
Each type of sediment forms a different sedimentary rock. Here are some examples of sedimentary rocks:
Sandstone forms from sand. Sand is usually deposited by wind in deserts and by water on beaches.
Shale and mudstone form from mud. Mud is often deposited at the bottom of oceans and deep lakes.
Limestone forms from sediment made mostly of the shells of marine organisms. This type of sediment is often deposited in the ocean near coral reefs.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Hari is a jaguar from this group. Hari has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.",closed choice,grade7,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive,"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.","Hari's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Hari's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hari's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Hari's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Assistant: The answer is C) 4/4. The probability that an American curl cat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the ear type gene is 4/4. This is because the cross involves two American curl cats, which are homozygous dominant for the ear type gene.

Hydrogen is (). A) an elementary substance B) a compoundThe image has been described as: The structure of the H2 molecule.
 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is elementary substance. BECAUSE: An element is a substance that cannot be separated or broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Chemical elements contain one type of atom. A pure chemical element is composed of only a single atom. Each different atom has its own atomic number.
Every chemical element has a different number of protons in each of its atoms, and this is what makes it a different element. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, and all atoms with 9 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element fluorine.
There are 118 known elements, but only the first 94 occur naturally on Earth. The other 24 elements are made in laboratories.
The smallest particle into which an element can be divided and still have the properties of that element is an atom.
An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms.
Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 30 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in short 0.000 000 000 3 m) in diameter.
Atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects.
In chemistry and physics, atomic weight is the ratio of the average mass per atom of a chemical element from a given sample to 1/12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom.
The atomic weight is dimensionless because the unit of mass is the same for both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio.
The standard atomic weight is the weighted average of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as they naturally occur on Earth, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative","User: Complete the statement.
Hydrogen is (). A) an elementary substance B) a compoundThe image has been described as: two white oval shaped objects with the letters h and h
 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is elementary substance. BECAUSE: A substance is a type of matter with a particular chemical composition. An elementary substance cannot be separated or simplified into different types of matter. It is made of one type of atom.
Elementary substances can be pure substances. A pure substance is a substance that has a fixed composition. It always has the same properties.
A compound is a type of pure substance. It is made of two or more chemical elements that are chemically bonded. The chemical elements are in a fixed ratio.
So, the statement ""Hydrogen is a compound"" is false, making the answer ""an elementary substance""."

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.

Assistant: The answer is C) sample A.
The average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample is proportional to the temperature of the sample.
The average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample can be calculated by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its speed.
The speed of a particle is the distance it travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.
The speed of a particle can be calculated by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes to travel that distance.
The distance a particle travels can be calculated by multiplying its speed by the time it travels.
The time it takes a particle to travel a certain distance can be calculated by dividing the distance by its speed.
The mass of a particle is a measure of how much matter it contains.
The mass of a particle can be calculated by dividing its weight by the acceleration due to gravity.
The weight of a particle is a measure of the gravitational force acting on it.
The weight of a particle can be calculated by multiplying its mass by the acceleration due to gravity.
The acceleration due to gravity is the rate at which the speed of a falling object changes as it falls.
The acceleration due to gravity is a constant value on Earth.

chicken cooking in an oven","['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']",1,,closed choice,grade7,natural science,chemistry,Chemical reactions,Compare physical and chemical changes,"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.

Assistant: The answer is C) Both are caused by heating.

Explanation:
Both changes involve the application of heat, which is a common cause of physical and chemical changes. However, in the case of a slice of banana turning brown, it is a physical change because the banana's molecular structure remains the same, but its color and texture change. On the other hand, chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change because the proteins in the chicken are denatured and broken down into simpler compounds, which changes the molecular structure of the chicken. Therefore, both changes are caused by heating, but only the chicken cooking in an oven is a chemical change.","User: What do these two changes have in common?

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Blossom is a horse from this group. Blossom has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.",closed choice,grade6,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive,"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.","Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Blossom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

The average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample is proportional to the temperature of the sample.
The average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample is calculated by dividing the total kinetic energy of the particles by the number of particles in the sample.
The total kinetic energy of the particles in a sample is calculated by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its speed.
The speed of a particle is determined by the temperature of the sample.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.

Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.

Assistant: The answer is B) Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

A piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan is a chemical change because it involves the breakdown of complex organic molecules into simpler compounds due to the action of microorganisms. This process releases gases and produces a foul odor.

Burning a candle is also a chemical change because it involves the combustion of wax and wick materials, which releases heat, light, and gases. This process requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Therefore, both changes involve chemical reactions that transform the original substances into new compounds.","User: What do these two changes have in common?

White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.
The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.
Figure: a white sea urchin in the ocean.",closed choice,grade7,natural science,biology,Ecological interactions,Classify symbiotic relationships,"When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.
Type of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species...
Commensal | benefits | is not significantly affected
Mutualistic | benefits | benefits
Parasitic | benefits | is harmed (but not usually killed)","When a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin, the worm is protected from predators by the sea urchin's sharp spines. So, the worm benefits from its relationship with the sea urchin.
The sea urchin's ability to survive does not change when a worm lives on it. So, the sea urchin is not significantly affected by its relationship with the worm.
Since the worm benefits and the sea urchin is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin.",Sea urchin,a sea urchin with purple and white stripes on its body,"A close-up image shows a purple and white starfish lying on the sand.

Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. Cookies are made from cookie dough. Baking turns the cookie dough into cookies. The cookies are a different type of matter than the dough.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.

water evaporating from a puddleA) Both are caused by cooling. B) Both are chemical changes. C) Both are caused by heating. D) Both are only physical changes.
 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is A) Both are caused by cooling.

Explanation:
Both changes involve a decrease in temperature, which causes the substances to change their physical state. In the case of baking cookies, the dough is heated until it solidifies into a cookie. This is a physical change because the composition of the dough remains the same, but its physical state changes from a soft, malleable substance to a solid, crunchy one.

On the other hand, when water evaporates from a puddle, it changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. This is also a physical change because the composition of the water remains the same, but its physical state changes from a liquid to a gas.

Therefore, both changes are caused by cooling, which causes the substances to change their physical state.","User: What do these two changes have in common?

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.

In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body.

Assistant: The answer is D) 2:2. The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 2:2.

Assistant: The answer is D) 2:2.

The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 2:2. This is because there are two alleles for each gene (A and B), and each parent can pass on either allele to their offspring. The possible combinations of alleles are AA, AB, BA, and BB.

In the case of AA and BB, the offspring will have a normal-sized body. In the case of AB and BA, the offspring will have a dwarf body. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 2:2.","User: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body?

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is D) 2:2.

The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 2:2. This is because the genotypes of the parents are Bb and Bb, which means that they both have one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b). When they produce offspring, there is a 50% chance that the offspring will inherit the dominant allele (B) and a 50% chance that the offspring will inherit the recessive allele (b).

Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 2:2, meaning that there is an equal chance of the offspring having either a normal-sized body or a dwarf body."

Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.","The two bottles of water have the same mass but different temperatures.

Charlotte was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Charlotte wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.
So, Charlotte put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.","An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The answer is B) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. BECAUSE: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
The strength of a magnetic force is affected by the distance between magnets. The magnetic force is greater when the magnets are closer together. As the distance between magnets increases, the magnetic force becomes weaker.","User: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?

Marcy and Brenda were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.
They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.

First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).
Dolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive,"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.","Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Dolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

 Let's think step by step and explain your reasoning! 
Assistant: The motorboat that moved 150miles north in 10hours was moving at the lowest speed.

To compare the motion of the three motorboats, we need to calculate their speeds. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

A) a motorboat that moved 185miles west in 10hours:
Speed = 185miles / 10hours = 18.5miles/hour

B) a motorboat that moved 150miles north in 10hours:
Speed = 150miles / 10hours = 15miles/hour

C) a motorboat that moved 250miles west in 10hours:
Speed = 250miles / 10hours = 25miles/hour

For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two Syrian hamsters.",closed choice,grade8,natural science,biology,Genes to traits,Use Punnett squares to calculate probabilities of offspring types,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

Nate used a dropper to put equal-sized drops of pure water, one at a time, onto a penny. The drops stayed together and formed a dome on the penny's surface. Nate recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies.

First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal on the bike changes into rust. Metal and rust are different types of matter.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
